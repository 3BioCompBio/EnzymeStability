# EnzymeStability

In this repository there are all files associated to our manuscript "Enzyme stability-activity trade-off: new insights from protein stability weaknesses and evolutionary conservation". Here their list:

• EnzymeStability.zip: File containing the plots for each enzyme in our dataset of the per-site folding free energy contribution ∆Gi (in kcal/mol) of residue i as a function of its distance d_i (in Ångström) from the closest catalytic residue, averaged over bins of 1.5 Ångström. 

• ListPDB551.dat: List of PDB codes corresponding to all 551 enzymes included in the DCSA dataset.
